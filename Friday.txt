P.Lord, You will keep me safe and protect me forever.
P.I place my soul and my body tonight in Your safekeeping, Papa, and in Your safekeeping, Jesus, and in Your safekeeping, Spirit of perfect truth.
The Three who defend my cause keep me from harm tonight.
B.Psalm 143:1 - I call on You, God, for You will answer me; give ear to me and hear my prayer.
B.Psalm 17:7 - Show the wonder of Your great love,You who save by Your right hand those who take refuge in You  from their foes.
B.Psalm 17:8 - Keep me as the apple of Your eye; hide me in the shadow of your wings.
B.2 Samuel 22:29
P.Lighten my darkness, Lord.
Let the light of Your presence dispel the shadows of night.
P.Jesus with me sleeping,
Jesus with me waking,
Jesus with me watching, every day and every night.
P.Save me, Jesus, while I am awake, guard me while I am asleep; that, awake, I may watch with You, and, asleep, may rest in Your peace.
P. God with me protecting, the Lord with me directing, the Spirit with me strengthening forever and for evermore.
P.In the name of the precious Father, and of the Spirit of healing balm. In the name of the Lord Jesus, I lay myself down to rest.
P.The peace of all peace be mine tonight
in your name Papa, Jesus and Spirit. 
Amen
W.
