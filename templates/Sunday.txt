W.
The Sacred Three
to save
to shield
to surround
the hearth
the home
this night
and every night.
B.Psalm 139:23-24
P.Papa, Jesus, Spirit, forgive my sins.
Only-begotten Son of the heavenly Father, forgive.
God who is one,
God who is true,
God who is first,
God who is one substance,
God only mighty, in three Persons, truly merciful, forgive.
P.God of life, tonight, don’t darken Your light to me.
P.God of life, tonight, don’t close Your gladness to my sight.
P.Keep Your people, Lord, in the arms of Your embrace.
Shelter them under Your wings.
P.Be their light in darkness.
Be their hope in distress.
Be their calm in anxiety.
Be strength in their weakness.
Be their comfort in pain.
Be their song in the night.
B.Psalm 4:8 - I will lie down in peace, for it is You, Lord, You alone who makes me to rest securely.
P.May it be on Your own beloved arm, God of grace, that I shall awake in peace.
P.May the peace of the Spirit be mine tonight.
May the peace of the Son be mine tonight.
May the peace of the Father be mine tonight.
May the peace of all peace be mine tonight
P.In your name Papa, Jesus and Spirit. Amen
W.
