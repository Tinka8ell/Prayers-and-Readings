T.Wednesday - The Felgild Compline
W.
P.Calm me, O Lord, as You stilled the storm.
Still me, O Lord, keep me from harm.
Let all the tumult within me cease.
Enfold me, Lord, in Your peace.
P.Father, bless the work that is done, and the work that is to be.
Father, bless the servant that I am, and the servant that I will be.
P.You, Lord and God of power, shield and sustain me tonight.
P.Tonight, I lie down with You, Papa, and You will lie down with me;
Tonight, I lie down with You, Jesus, and You will lie down with me;
Tonight, I lie down with You, Spirit, and You will lie down with me;
God and Jesus and Spirit, will lie down with me.
P.The peace of God be over me to shelter me, under me to uphold me, about me to protect me, behind me to direct me, ever with me to save me.
P.The peace of all peace be mine tonight
in your name Papa, Jesus and Spirit. 
Amen
W.
