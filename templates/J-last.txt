T.J's Last Prayer of the Day
P.Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, who brings sleep to my eyes, slumber to my eyelids. 
P.May it be Your will, Lord my God, that I lie down in peace and that I arise in peace. 
P.Let my sleep be undisturbed by troubling thoughts, bad dreams, and wicked schemes. 
P.May I have a night of tranquil slumber. 
P.May I awaken to the light of a new day, that my eyes may behold the splendour of Your light. 
P.Praised are You, Lord whose glory gives light to the entire world.
