T.J's First Prayer of the Day
P.Blessed are you, LORD our God, King of the universe,
who forms light and creates darkness,
who makes peace and creates all things.
P.Blessed are you, LORD, who forms light.
P.I gratefully thank you, O living and eternal King, for You have returned my soul within me with compassion - abundant is Your faithfulness!
