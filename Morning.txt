H.Canticle
P.Jesus, as my light, illuminate and guide me.
As my shield, protect me.
Jesus lift me up; direct me;
Come alongside me, on my left and on my right.
P.Today be my core and aroma, gently powerfully
In the heart of those I speak to; and speak to me through them.
P.Today be my center and encircle me with Your powerful love.
You are my light, my shield.
You are on my left and on my right.
H.Blessing
P.Your peace go with me, wherever You take me.
Guide me when I am lost.  Protect me when I am scared.
Bring me home rejoicing at the wonders You have shown me.
Bring me home rejoicing once again into my flat.
P.In your name Papa, Jesus and Spirit. Amen

P.Father, help me to live this day to the full, being true to You, in every way.
Jesus, help me to give myself away to others, being kind to everyone I meet.
